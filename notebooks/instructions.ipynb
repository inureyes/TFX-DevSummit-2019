    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is designed to introduce TensorFlow Extended (TFX)\n",
    "and help you learn to create your own machine learning\n",
    "pipelines.  We'll follow a typical ML development process,\n",
    "starting by examining the dataset, and end up with a complete\n",
    "working pipeline.  Along the way we'll explore ways to debug\n",
    "and update your pipeline, and measure performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step by Step\n",
    "We'll gradually create our pipelines by working step by step,\n",
